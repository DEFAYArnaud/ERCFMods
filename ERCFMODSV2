To probably get everything to make up will probably be the V2 at somepoint requires pulling files from 4 different repos

So of course the main ERCF repo here, some stls will still need to be used from it. Do not print the blocks, and the mains parts that use the threaded rods to hold everything together, see the sturdy bunny project below.
https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject

Then the sturdy bunny project which replaces the threaded rods with a piece of 2020 https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/SturdyBunnyProject If you are going tiple decky then do not print any of the blocks, only the parts needed to attach the ERCF to the 2020.

Triple decky this is really a whole redesign of the blocks for loading and unloading filament, version V6.3 is the latest and this allows 3 position servo control over each filament block, really innovate work here from gneu. https://github.com/gneu42/Triple-Decky

Then also springy which fixes the issues of various pressure requirements to feed filament on each block https://github.com/moggieuk/ERCF-Springy

Then you have Happy Hare V2 which is the software that makes it all happen https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare

Also blinky is a nice upgrade to the optical encoder for filament encoding https://github.com/mneuhaus/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/usermods/Binky

And last a filament cutter which I think is a must have https://github.com/sorted01/Filametrix
